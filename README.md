# Quiz Game

The goal of this project is to develop a questions and answers game in order to put in practice the concepts I learned studying go lang.

The game contains some questions with multiple alternatives. The user should pick the correct answer. In the end of the game, 
a score will be generated for the user.

The game is based on a csv file that contains all the questions and answers of the game.
